# Hubs Discord Moderator Guidelines
_For Hubs Foundation (Volunteer) Staff_

_These are guidelines only.  Moderators will take appropriate actions on a case by case basis._<br>
_(All moderators are free to propose changes)_


* **NSFW stuff**
  - Check whether the user has made any legitimate posts
  - Ban the user, select other and type in NSFW for the reason, and select the correct time frame for deleting their posts (they usually only have NSFW posts so you can probably select the past 7 days as the timeline to make sure you get them all)
  - Post in the #mods channel that you’ve banned a NSFW user (include the user’s name).
* **Malicious content, e.g. links**
  - This tool can be used to check URL shortened links: https://urlscan.io/
  - Check whether the user has made any legitimate posts
  - Ban the user, select other and type in Malicious content for the reason, and select the correct time frame for deleting their posts (they usually only have malicious messages so you can probably select the past 7 days as the timeline to make sure you get them all)
  - Post in the #mods channel that you’ve banned a user posting malicious content (include the user’s name).
* **Inappropriate user/display name, but otherwise hasn’t caused trouble**
  - If highly inappropriate (or thought to be), time out the user for a week.
  - Discuss with the moderator team.
* **Suspected spam**
  - Copy the message link and post it in the #mods channel for confirmation by other moderators, then if confirmed, delete it and DM the user to let them know why their post was deleted.
    - Example user notification:
      Hello o/
      Hubs Discord moderator here.
      Your message in the X channel was removed because it was off topic and inappropriate.  You are welcome to participate with any on topic discussions about Hubs (the 3D metaverse platform).
* **Roblox spam**
  - Delete the messages.
  - Notify the user that this isn't a roblox server and their post in X channel on the Hubs Discord was off topic and so was deleted.
    - Example user notification:
      Hello o/
      Hubs Discord moderator here.
      The Hubs Discord doesn't have anything to do with Roblox, so your message in the X channel was deleted as per our no spam rule.  If you have any Hubs related questions/topics you wish to discuss you are welcome to. :)
      If the user has already left the server, just delete the messages.
* **Repeated spam**
  - If the messages were bordering on a scam and the user has been warned once already (and/or quickly re-offends):
    - Ban the user.
    - If it looks like the user is a real person, inform them that their access to the server has been restricted.
  - If the messages aren’t bordering on a scam, but they have no relevant messages:
    - Warn 3 times.
    - Timeout after 1st and following warns (in response to the 2nd offense and following offenses).
    - Ban after 3rd warn (in response to the 4th offense).
    - If it looks like the user is a real person, inform them that their access to the server has been restricted.
* **Invite link spam**
  (a bunch of invite links to another Discord server posted in a short time)
  - If the user is new or has no relevant messages:
    - Ban the user.
    - Select “Suspicious or spam account” for the reason, and select the past 7 days time frame for deleting their posts.
  - If the user has posted relevant messages before:
    - Delete the messages.
    - Warn the user via DM that Invite link spamming isn’t acceptable.
* **Advertising outside of the Job Board**
  - Some leeway is allowed, it is up to the moderator to determine whether it’s just mostly innocent conversation or enough advertising to warrant action.
  - If it is determined to warrant action: delete the message(s), DM the user to let them know why their post was deleted, and post a record of it to the #mods channel.
    - Example user notification:
      Hello o/
      Hubs Discord moderator here.
      Your message in the X channel was removed because advertising isn't allowed outside of the https://discord.com/channels/498741086295031808/1060630294937468968.  You are welcome to make a post in the https://discord.com/channels/498741086295031808/1060630294937468968 provided you follow the post guidelines.
* **Non-Hubs related advertising**
  - Delete the messages and message the user.  If the user repeats their behavior, refer to the repeated spam guidelines.
  - Example user notification:
    Hello o/
    Hubs Discord moderator here.
    Your messages in the Hubs Discord server were removed because advertising is only allowed in the Job Board and it must be related to Hubs. Cross posting is also not allowed. However, you are welcome to participate with any on topic discussions about Hubs (the 3D metaverse platform).
* **Job board posts that don’t follow the rules**
  - Identify yourself as a moderator and ask for the poster to update the post with the relevant information.
  - If the poster hasn’t updated their post or responded to you within 1 week, take the appropriate action as dictated in the job board rules/post guidelines.
  - DM the user after an action has been taken to let them know what has happened and why.
  - If you are unsure what to do, copy the message link and post it in the #mods channel for discussion.
  - The Job Board rules can be found in the Post Guidelines section of the Job Board, accessible via the button indicated here:
    ![image that shows where the post guidelines can be found in Discord](/images/discord-job-board-post-guidelines-location.png)
* **Off topic messages in the general channel**
  - Reply to the user that the general channel isn’t the best place for their messages and direct them to the proper channel.
  - Share the message link in the #mods channel and let the other moderators know that you’ve taken care of it.

New rule suggestion for the Hubs Discord server: 
Make posts relevant to Hubs
Any post that does not directly address the subject of Hubs needs to be contextualized by the member posting.

As implemented by the moderators, this rule should primarily apply to the original/solo post or the first post in a thread in a channel by a member. Does the post have an obvious connection (not stated) or an obvious stated connection/relevance to Hubs or the Hubs Community? 

Examples of posts that are OK:  

  “I am a front end engineer looking for a job, I have 3 years experience with Hubs. Here is my LinkedIn account.”  Post is relevant to Hubs and appropriate for the job-board channel.

  Link to tech updates to Reticulum new article.  Post is fine. No context is made, but post is related to Hubs. Probably best for random or the dev channels.

Examples of post that are not OK:

  Link only to site for a cannot-be-safely-determined purpose. No obvious connection to Hubs. No added context to Hubs.
  
Introduction posts, generally, should NOT be held to this rule if the OP is simply an introduction; a hello from a brand new member. Leeway should be granted as folks might arrive in the Discord server *truly not knowing what Hubs is or is about* and they are not required to make introductions to be Hubs relevant. However, if the member provides a link to something in their introduction that blatantly does not appear to be Hubs-relevant, this rule DOES apply. See the Moderators delete guidance below.

Reply posts, generally, should NOT be held to this rule. However, reply posts need to adhere, of course, to all of the Discord server rules. For example, if an original post asks for software recommendations to accomplish X, replies might not necessarily recommend Hubs, and that is fine.

**Moderators are responsible for doing some research about a post to see if it is related to Hubs**; they should try out links in a safe manner. The onus of proof is not entirely upon the original poster.

Moderators could delete posts, then directly message the member that the original poster is welcome to re-post if they add context about connection to Hubs. If the member refuses, the original post stays deleted. If a member posts repeatedly, is messaged about relevance, and does not re-post, the Moderators could take this as a reason to remove the member from the server. All this could be documented in the admin private channel.

The random (and off-topic?) channel should have a wide leeway for posts not related to Hubs. Still, all Discord server rules apply. Most of the posts we’ve seen that have been deleted are blatant server violations. When in doubt, it is safest to take a post out of public view while it is being discussed with other Mods.
