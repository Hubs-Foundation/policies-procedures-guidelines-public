# Vision and Guiding Principles

## Vision

Our vision is simple: to build an open, decentralized, high quality, unopinionated, web-based metaverse that puts freedom of expression, privacy, community, and integrity first.

## Guiding Principles

Our guiding principles are the firm foundation that we stand on to bring our vision into reality.

### Unopinionated Freedom of Expression

We believe our job is to empower people to create what they want; that we should create technology and tools that are flexible and that don't constrain people to a single art style or way of doing things, but rather enables them to have/create the experience they want.  This also means that we support minority features/use cases.  So whether 100% of people will need it or only 1%, if we can reasonably provide it, or a way to support them creating it, that doesn't inhibit the rest of our users, we will endeavour to do so.

### Quality

We want to build a world class metaverse that is solid and dependable.  To do that, we impose strict quality controls on all contributions (both internal and external) and work together to make sure each feature is carefully designed from the beginning so that it fits into our vision.

### Openness and Transparency

We believe that by making everything open and transparent, at all levels, we empower people, encourage collaboration, experimentation, participation, and that the whole project benefits as a result.

### Privacy

We believe that privacy is important, that you should have control of what you share, that you shouldn't be tracked without your consent, and that you should be able to feel safe and confident with the tools and services you use and the metaverse you create.

### Open Source

As an open source project ourselves, we value and prioritize open source and the freedom and control it gives us to take full command of our own experiences.  While we don't object in general to proprietary software, we will either seek open source solutions first, or at least try to make sure there is an open source option.

### Inclusion and Diversity and Mutual Respect

We welcome everyone from everywhere and believe that by cultivating a culture of inclusion and sharing that is based on mutual respect that we will enrich each other and make a better world.

### Sustainability

We believe in playing the long game, in doing things the right way from the beginning.  Basically, we put out the fires before they start and do things in a way that works, is likely to keep working, and won't burn us all out along the way.

### Integrity

In a world where too often it seems that money is the only important thing, we value doing what's right and sticking by our principles.  That means that in everything we do, from the products we create to the services we use and/or recommend, we will do our best to make sure they align with our principles.  This isn't always easy (or sometimes even fully possible), so we must all do our part to keep us on track and speak up when needed.  We want to create something that we can all feel good about and proud of, without reservation.

### Community and Culture

The community and its culture of giving is at the heart of our project.  Each of us comes from the community and so we all decide the future of Hubs together.  All of us play a part in defining our culture by the choices we make, the little things that we do, and the time we put in.  This is what makes it worth our time to keep participating, and we believe in preserving and celebrating the community and all the little (and big) things that make it special.  Hubs will survive as long as there are devoted people who care about it.

### Fun and Enjoyment and Wonder

We believe that fun and enjoyment and wonder are important.and coexist with and enhance the other high bars that we set for the project.  Let's face it, if we aren't evoking these emotions in people then we're doing something wrong because what could be more awesome or inspiring than being able to create and shape a shared metaverse, from the three dimensional constructs to the underlying code!  Hubs presents us with infinite possibilities and we believe it's our job to embrace it and make sure this is highlighted and never lost.
