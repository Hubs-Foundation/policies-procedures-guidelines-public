# Policy/Procedure/Guidelines Proposal Policy

## Submitting Proposals

Proposals for changes/additions to our policies, procedures, or guidelines can be submitted as pull requests to this repository and will remain open for a *minimum* of one week so that they can have a chance to be discussed.  They will then require at least one approval from the Governance Team from someone other than the originator of the proposal in order to be adopted/merged.

## Announcing Changes (currently suspended)

Once a proposal pull request has been approved and merged, an announcement about the changes will be made in Discord that includes a link to the merged pull request.  If multiple proposals are approved and merged at the same time, the combined changes can be announced together in a single Discord announcement.  Updates that don't functionally change anything (e.g. typo fixes, formatting, etc.) do not need to be announced.
