# Showcasing Community Events
_For Hubs Foundation (Volunteer) Staff_

If you have permission and want to promote an event from the Community Events Discord channel, you can post about it in the Promoted Events Discord channel.  You can also add a Discord event for it, if you feel it is appropriate.

For posting in the Promoted Events Discord channel, use the template below.

Text surrounded by angle brackets is meant to be replaced with the appropriate content for the event you’re promoting (make sure to replace the angle brackets as well).

You can use https://c.r74n.com/discord/timestamps to generate Discord timestamps.  Use the “Month/Day/Year” format (`<t:xxxxxxxxxxx:d>`) for `<PostDay>` and the “Time” format (`<t:xxxxxxxxxxx:t>`) for `<PostTime>` in the template below.

You will need to adjust the formatting for the “box” around the event title/author/time (e.g. Hubs Holiday Party `@AuthorName` – 12/8/24 12:54 PM) for each event (keep a two space border on the left and right sides).

You can grab the link to the thumbnail for `<LinkToPostThumbnail>` by clicking on the image in the community event post, then right-clicking on the image that comes up and selecting “Copy Image Link”.  If the community event doesn’t have a thumbnail, remove the line: `[.](<LinkToPostThumbnail>)` from your post.

Note: it can be a little tricky to get the formatting right, so test this first somewhere private (e.g. your own private Discord server), if you can.

## Example:

![image that shows what the template will look like when rendered in Discord](/images/showcasing-community-events-example.png)

## Template:

```
**COMMUNITY EVENT**
<LinkToEventPost>
> **• ------------------------------- •**
> **|  <EventName>                 	|**
> **|**  *@<EventAuthorUsername> — <PostDay> <PostTime>*  **|**
> **• ------------------------------- •**
> <PostContent>
[.](<LinkToPostThumbnail>)
```
