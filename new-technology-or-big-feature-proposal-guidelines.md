# [DRAFT] New Technology / Big Feature Proposal Guidelines
Technology is always advancing; new languages, frameworks, and libraries become available; new paradigms, systems, and feature sets are developed.  While these new things can offer significant improvements to Hubs, they can also have drawbacks and tradeoffs.  In order to make sure that the risks to Hubs are minimized, they must be discussed beforehand and a proposal created.
* To open a proposal, add an issue prefixed with [Proposal] to the appropriate repository.  If the proposal would span multiple repositories, place it in the hubs repository.
  - Check to make sure that a proposal on this topic hasnâ€™t already been opened or that your idea differs enough to have its own separate proposal.
* The proposal must include a description of what you are proposing.
* The proposal must include sections that describe why you are proposing it, what limitations it addresses, what improvements it brings, and what drawbacks/limitations/user privacy implications it would have.
* The proposal will then be reviewed, discussed, have changes proposed, get updated, etc. until a consensus is reached with the team/team lead to either adopt or reject the proposal.
