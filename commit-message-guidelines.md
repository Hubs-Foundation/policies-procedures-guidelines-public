# Commit Message Guidelines

[Atomic commits](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/atomic-git-commits/) are preferred.

## Subject/Title

* Separate the title/subject of the commit message from the body of the commit message with a blank line.
* Try to keep the title/subject descriptive and concise.
* Capitalize the title/subject line, make sure it completes the sentence "if applied, this commit...", and don't end the line with a period.

## Body

* Explain what the commit does.
* Explain why the commit does what it does.
* Add any additional details that could be useful.

## Example

Add commit message guidelines

What:
Adds guidelines for commit messages to be used by contributors in all of our projects.

Why:
This keeps things standardized and predictable and encourages people to include the very important context of why they're making their changes.

Note:
The example for the body of the commit message doesn't have to be followed exactly, the most important part is that the commit message is clear and informative, but I find the headings useful for saving brain power by essentially just giving me a form to fill out, and helping make sure I think about what context I need to convey so that others (including my future self) will understand what I'm doing.
