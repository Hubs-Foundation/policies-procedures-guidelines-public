# [DRAFT] Direct Commit Rights Guidelines
_For Hubs Foundation (Volunteer) Staff_

## Direct commits to Main/Master

* Don’t, unless it is a special case with a very good reason.  Create a branch/PR and get that reviewed and merged instead.

## Merging PRs without review when reviewers are available
* Don’t, unless it is a special case with a very good reason.
  - A special case could be that the PR is very simple/low risk and the unfixed version is likely to be/is actively harming people in some way. An example of this: https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation/Hubs-Backup-Tool/pull/24 (very low risk because it’s just changing documentation and leaving it unfixed could cause people to download an old version of the backup tool that would miss backing up things)
