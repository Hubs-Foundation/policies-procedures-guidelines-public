# Share of the Month
_For Hubs Foundation (Volunteer) Staff_

**Choose the Share of the Month:**
* First narrow it down to the top 3 #show-and-tell-ðŸŽ‰ posts that had the most interactions (emoji reactions, comments, etc.) for that month.
* The top three are then voted on and the one with the most votes wins the Share of the Month.

**Release the Share of the Month:**
* If the Share of the Month post wasn't marked with the promotable tag, contact the author and ask if it can be shared to social media (not applicable until the Hubs Foundation sets up social media).
* Assign the Share of the Month tag to the winner's post.
* Assign the Share of the Month role to the winning user.
* Post an announcement in the #announcements channel in Discord.
* Post an announcement to social media (if the author has given permission and there is social media to post to).
